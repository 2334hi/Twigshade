                <p>"Twigshade" has records existing back to the prehistoric era. It is said to of risen from a mutated waters, spilled out of anger to defend the forest. Invaders that dare tread and disturb the tranquality of the region often awake Twigshade. However in its rage, it would poison its own domain.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Twigshade is an sentient plant evolving from unknown rapid mutations. Such mutations make the creature into a formiddable beast - attacking any who disturb its domain. When Twigshade rises from the roots, it grapples onto the nearby trees, allowing it to traverse through the air via grappling. Twigshade's roots are also detachable, thus allowing it to burrow around the region.</p>

                Twigshade remains in slumber as long as no one disturbs its surrounding area. When awoken, it will attempt to decimate all living organisms in its vascenity. When it feels successful, it returns to slumber. It is believed to have a special mutation though such information on it is unkown at this time.
